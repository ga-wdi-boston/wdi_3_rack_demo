## Rack 

[Rack](http://rack.github.io/) provides a minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks.  

[Quick Intro to Rack](http://rubylearning.com/blog/a-quick-introduction-to-rack/)

The Part1, Part2 and Part3 directories have a more in-depth into to Rack. Each directory has a README that explains how to work through each demo. _Left as an exercise for the reader_

### Demo

#### Show the simplest Rack app possible.  
Will show the current time.

This application, _a simple Ruby lambda_ , is passed an environment Ruby hash that contains the HTTP Request Header.

This app will return an array with three entries:  
1. A HTTP Status Code, 200 is the code for OK.  
2. A Ruby hash that contains the HTTP Response Header.  
3. Any Object that responds to the 'each' method.  __This will be the body of the page you will see in the browser__


##### Run the Rack app.
 
```
ruby lambda_time.rb
```

##### Send a HTTP Request with curl.  
```
curl -i http://localhost:1234/this/is/my/path?name=jack&age=33
```

##### Send a HTTP Request with Chrome.  

http://localhost:1234/this%20is%20it/but/not%20the%20/end?name=jack&age=33

Open the Chrome Inspector and go to the Network tab. Refresh and look at the HTTP Request/Response.



#### Show the HTTP Request Headers

The lambda is passed an enviroment Hash built from the HTTP Request. Here we return a couple of entries in the environment hash.

```
ruby lambda_http_headers.rb
```

```
curl -i http://localhost:1234/this/is/my/path?name=jack&age=33
```

In Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.  
http://localhost:1234/this%20is%20it/but/not%20the%20/end?name=jack&age=33

### Lab
Write a simple Rack app that will fill in the blanks in the below text from URL params. The filled in text will be returned by the HTTP Response. The word in __bold__ are going to be replaced by URL params.

"__Who__ arrested __name__ for __crime__ earlier this week, and according to a report by the __source__, the incident stemmed from a dispute over a __object__."

Example:  
"__Police__ arrested __a Main Street resident__ for __illegal possession of a handgun and ammunition__ earlier this week, and according to a report __in the Lowell Sun__, the incident stemmed from a dispute over a __frozen cheese pizza__."

http://localhost:1234/?who=The Police&name=a Main Street resident&crime=possesion of a handgun&source=in the Lowell Sun&object=frozen cheess pizza


##### Question what are the %20 in the response?

### Demo

#### Same as above but use a Ruby class.

Just add a call method to a Ruby class to make it a Rack app! 

The call method takes one argument, the enviroment Hash built from the HTTP Request.

This uses a convenvience class, [Rack::Request](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/request.rb), provided by Rack. It gives one access to 
the HTTP Request.

And it uses a class, Rack::Response , provided by Rack. 
This can be used to build a HTTP Response.

Notice the Rack::Request#params method. Take a look at the ruby code for this params method. It just converts the query string 'name=jack&age=33' to {'name' => 'jack', 'age=33'}.

```
ruby bin/http_headers_app.rb
```

```
curl -i http://localhost:3000/this%20is%20it/but/not%20the%20/end?name=tom
```

Enter this URL into Chrome and open the Chrome debugger.


### Lab
Write our own Rack app, bin/rack_params.rb, and implement a _params_ method that will turn the URL params in the HTTP Request into a hash. 

Show this hash in the HTTP Response body.


Enter this in Chrome:  
```
http://localhost:3000/?name=tom&age=57&city=Groton&state=MA
```

To get:  
```
{:name=>"tom", :age=>"57", :city=>"Groton", :state=>"MA"}
```

## Demo 

Let's create a _rackup_. 


"rackup is a useful tool for running Rack applications. rackup automatically figures out the environment it is run in, and runs your application as FastCGI, CGI, or standalone with Mongrel or WEBrick – all from the same configuration.

To use rackup, you’ll need to supply it with a rackup config file. By convention, you should use .ru extension for a rackup config file. Supply it a run RackObject and you’re ready to go:

By default, rackup will start a server on port 9292." [Rack Tutorial](http://rubylearning.com/blog/a-quick-introduction-to-rack/#C7)

Take a look at config.ru. Simple rack app that is run by rackup.


```
rackup config.ru
```
